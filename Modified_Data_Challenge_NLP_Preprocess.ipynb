The Bugaboo II--which sleeps up to five people--is equipped with both a Cyclone venting system and a GoBe Dry rain protection system. The Cyclone system greatly increases the air circulation within the tent, helping you stay cool on warmer days or dry out after a nasty rainstorm. The GoBe Dry system, meanwhile, ensures that the pounding rain won't find a way inside.The Bugaboo II also includes plenty of room for storage, with two external storage lockers, several internal pockets, a gear loft for packs or valuables, and even multiple cupholders for holding coffee, soft drinks, or beer bottles. Other details include color-coded fiberglass poles and sleeves for easy setup, a polyester taffeta body and rainfly, and a Camp Port for cable passage. The Bugaboo II measures 12 by 6.16 by 9 feet (W x H x D), weighs 21 pounds, and comes in a fossil, carbon, and boa combination.Key Features:Sleeps 5 campersGoBe Dry Ultimate Rain Protection systemCamp Port to allow easy passage of cablesCyclone Venting to allow for better air circulation when rainfly is in useTwo external storage lockers, internal pockets, cupholders, and gear loftColor coded fiberglass poles and sleeves for easy set upPolyester taffeta body and rainflyWeighs 21 poundsAbout Columbia SportswearFounded in 1938, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown from a small family-owned hat distributor to one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of skiwear in the United States. Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60 year-old Gert began her role as \"Mother Boyle\" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry. Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.The Bugaboo II dome tent measures 12 by 9 feet and sleeps up to five people.Amazon.com Tent GuideSelecting a TentFortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind:Expect the WorstIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.Three- and Four-Season TentsFor summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive.Domes and TunnelsTents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.Size MattersAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.</td>\n",

              "1       Columbia Bugaboo II 12-Foot-by-9-Foot 4-Pole 5-Person Dome Tent [Discontinued] Bring the family to the campsite and still have room to spare with the Columbia Bugaboo II dome tent. The Bugaboo II--which sleeps up to five people--is equipped with both a Cyclone venting system and a GoBe Dry rain protection system. The Cyclone system greatly increases the air circulation within the tent, helping you stay cool on warmer days or dry out after a nasty rainstorm. The GoBe Dry system, meanwhile, ensures that the pounding rain won't find a way inside.The Bugaboo II also includes plenty of room for storage, with two external storage lockers, several internal pockets, a gear loft for packs or valuables, and even multiple cupholders for holding coffee, soft drinks, or beer bottles. Other details include color-coded fiberglass poles and sleeves for easy setup, a polyester taffeta body and rainfly, and a Camp Port for cable passage. The Bugaboo II measures 12 by 6.16 by 9 feet (W x H x D), weighs 21 pounds, and comes in a fossil, carbon, and boa combination.Key Features:Sleeps 5 campersGoBe Dry Ultimate Rain Protection systemCamp Port to allow easy passage of cablesCyclone Venting to allow for better air circulation when rainfly is in useTwo external storage lockers, internal pockets, cupholders, and gear loftColor coded fiberglass poles and sleeves for easy set upPolyester taffeta body and rainflyWeighs 21 poundsAbout Columbia SportswearFounded in 1938, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown from a small family-owned hat distributor to one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of skiwear in the United States. Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60 year-old Gert began her role as \"Mother Boyle\" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry. Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.The Bugaboo II dome tent measures 12 by 9 feet and sleeps up to five people.Amazon.com Tent GuideSelecting a TentFortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind:Expect the WorstIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.Three- and Four-Season TentsFor summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive.Domes and TunnelsTents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.Size MattersAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.  \n",

Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60 year-old Gert began her role as \"Mother Boyle\" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry. Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.The Bugaboo II dome tent measures 12 by 9 feet and sleeps up to five people.Amazon.com Tent GuideSelecting a TentFortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind:Expect the WorstIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.Three- and Four-Season TentsFor summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive.Domes and TunnelsTents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.Size MattersAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.</td>\n",

              "1       Columbia Bugaboo II 12-Foot-by-9-Foot 4-Pole 5-Person Dome Tent [Discontinued] Bring the family to the campsite and still have room to spare with the Columbia Bugaboo II dome tent. The Bugaboo II--which sleeps up to five people--is equipped with both a Cyclone venting system and a GoBe Dry rain protection system. The Cyclone system greatly increases the air circulation within the tent, helping you stay cool on warmer days or dry out after a nasty rainstorm. The GoBe Dry system, meanwhile, ensures that the pounding rain won't find a way inside.The Bugaboo II also includes plenty of room for storage, with two external storage lockers, several internal pockets, a gear loft for packs or valuables, and even multiple cupholders for holding coffee, soft drinks, or beer bottles. Other details include color-coded fiberglass poles and sleeves for easy setup, a polyester taffeta body and rainfly, and a Camp Port for cable passage. The Bugaboo II measures 12 by 6.16 by 9 feet (W x H x D), weighs 21 pounds, and comes in a fossil, carbon, and boa combination.Key Features:Sleeps 5 campersGoBe Dry Ultimate Rain Protection systemCamp Port to allow easy passage of cablesCyclone Venting to allow for better air circulation when rainfly is in useTwo external storage lockers, internal pockets, cupholders, and gear loftColor coded fiberglass poles and sleeves for easy set upPolyester taffeta body and rainflyWeighs 21 poundsAbout Columbia SportswearFounded in 1938, Columbia Sportswear Company has grown from a small family-owned hat distributor to one of the world's largest outerwear brands and the leading seller of skiwear in the United States. Columbia's extensive product line includes a wide variety of outerwear, sportswear, rugged footwear and accessories. Columbia specializes in developing innovative products that are functional yet stylish and offer great value. Eighty-year-old matriarch Gert Boyle, Chairman of the Board, and her son, Tim Boyle, President and CEO, lead the company.Columbia's history starts with Gert's parents, Paul and Marie Lamfrom, when they fled Germany in 1937. They bought a small hat distributorship in Portland, Oregon, and named it Columbia Hat Company, after the river bordering the city. Soon frustrated by poor deliveries from suppliers, the Lamfroms decided to start manufacturing products themselves. In 1948, Gert married college sweetheart Neal Boyle, who joined the family business and later took the helm of the growing company. When Neal suddenly died of a heart attack in 1970, Gert enlisted help from Tim, then a college senior. After that it wasn't long before business really started to take off. Columbia was one of the first companies to make jackets from waterproof/breathable fabric. They introduced the breakthrough technology called the Columbia Interchange System, in which a shell and liner combine for multiple wearing options. In the early 1980s, then 60 year-old Gert began her role as \"Mother Boyle\" in Columbia's successful and popular advertising campaign.The company went public in 1998 and moved into a new era as a world leader in the active outdoor apparel industry. Today, Columbia Sportswear employs more than 1,800 people around the world and distributes and sells products in more than 50 countries and to more than 12,000 retailers internationally.The Bugaboo II dome tent measures 12 by 9 feet and sleeps up to five people.Amazon.com Tent GuideSelecting a TentFortunately, there are all kinds of tents for weekend car campers, Everest expeditions, and everything in-between. Here are a few things to keep in mind:Expect the WorstIn general, it's wise to choose a tent that's designed to withstand the worst possible conditions you think you'll face. For instance, if you're a summer car camper in a region where weather is predictable, an inexpensive family or all purpose tent will likely do the trick--especially if a vehicle is nearby and you can make a mad dash for safety when bad weather swoops in! If you're a backpacker, alpine climber or bike explorer, or if you like to car camp in all seasons, you'll want to take something designed to handle more adversity.Three- and Four-Season TentsFor summer, early fall and late spring outings, choose a three-season tent. At minimum, a quality three season tent will have lightweight aluminum poles, a reinforced floor, durable stitching, and a quality rain-fly. Some three-season tents offer more open-air netting and are more specifically designed for summer backpacking and other activities. Many premium tents will feature pre-sealed, taped seams and a silicone-impregnated rain-fly for enhanced waterproofness.For winter camping or alpine travel, go with a four season model. Because they typically feature more durable fabric coatings, as well as more poles, four-season tents are designed to handle heavy snowfall and high winds without collapsing. Of course, four-season tents exact a weight penalty of about 10 to 20 percent in trade for their strength and durability. They also tend to be more expensive.Domes and TunnelsTents are broadly categorized into two types, freestanding, which can stand up on their own, and those that must be staked down in order to stand upright. Freestanding tents often incorporate a dome-shaped design, and most four-season tents are constructed this way because a dome leaves no flat spots on the outer surface where snow can collect. Domes are also inherently stronger than any other design. Meanwhile, many three-season models employ a modified dome configuration called a tunnel. These are still freestanding, but they require fewer poles than a dome, use less fabric, and typically have a rectangular floor-plan that offers less storage space than a dome configuration. Many one and two-person tents are not freestanding, but they make up for it by being more lightweight. Because they use fewer poles, they can also be quicker to set up than a dome.Size MattersAsk yourself how many people you'd like to fit in your fabric hotel now and in the future. For soloists and minimalists, check out one-person tents. If you're a mega-minimalist, or if you have your eye on doing some big wall climbs, a waterproof-breathable bivy sack is the ticket. Some bivy sacks feature poles and stake points to give you a little more breathing room. Also, if you don't need bug protection and you want to save weight, check out open-air shelters.Families who plan on car camping in good weather can choose from a wide range of jumbo-sized tents that will accommodate all your little ones with room to spare. A wide range of capacities is also available for three- and four-season backpacking and expedition tents. Remember, though, the bigger the tent you buy, the heavier it will be, although it's easy to break up the tent components among several people in your group. It's also helpful to compare the volume and floor-space measurements of models you're considering.  \n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Removed URLs**\n",
        "   - Regex added: `re.sub(r'http\\S+|www\\S+|https\\S+', '', text)`\n",
        "   - Purpose: Strip out web links that add noise and rarely help model learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Removed Email Addresses**\n",
        "   - Regex added: `re.sub(r'\\S+@\\S+', '', text)`\n",
        "   - Purpose: Eliminate emails, which are usually irrelevant to text analysis tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Removed Extra Whitespace**\n",
        "   - Regex added: `re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text).strip()`\n",
        "   - Purpose: Clean up after removing content, punctuation, and digits.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Added Custom Stopwords**\n",
        "   - Example stopwords added: `{'product', 'buy', 'price', 'click', 'item'}`\n",
        "   - Purpose: Filter out domain-specific words that are frequent but not informative.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Filtered by Part of Speech (POS)**\n",
        "   - Included POS tags: `{'NOUN', 'PROPN', 'ADJ'}`\n",
        "   - Purpose: Focus on semantically rich words (e.g., entities, objects, descriptors) and ignore low-signal words.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Combined All Steps Into One Function**\n",
        "   - All logic (cleaning, lemmatization, filtering) is now fully integrated in a single code cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Result:\n",
        "The updated function improves data quality and feature signal for downstream tasks like classification, clustering, or topic modeling.\n"
